# OpenYerWindows

Tiny app I started during a hackathon to determine the best times to open and close the windows on your home since I live in a hot climate. 

Uses HomeKit, WeatherKit, SwiftUI, Charts, CoreLocation, UserNotifications, and more!

Since this was a hackathon the code quality is rushed :)
